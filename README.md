# Overview

A simple cooking game created with the Godot Engine to practice basic concepts like composition, inheritance, object-oriented principles in Godot, and game development.
In this game, you move with WASD and interact with E. You will have to look for ingredients in the kitchen
and cook a cake for your customer to give you points before the time runs out. Once the game ends your highest score will be saved on your computer.
